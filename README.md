## 🔑 Key Insights

1. **ETH was virtually worthless in 2015–2016**, trading under $15.
2. **2017 was the first major bull run**, with ETH reaching ~$1,400.
3. **2021 saw the all-time high** of ~$4,800 driven by DeFi & NFT demand.
4. **2022 saw a massive crash** (−70%) due to macro tightening and FTX collapse.
5. **Daily returns are heavy-tailed** — far more extreme moves than traditional assets.
6. **Price and market cap are perfectly correlated** (supply is roughly stable daily).
7. **Volume spikes during volatile periods** — fear and greed both drive trading activity.
8. **Q4 historically shows higher average prices** (holiday rally effect).
